---

## ✅ FULLY COMPLETED WORK

### 1. Platform Detection Fixes

**Problem:** SystemCache cleaner was marked as "available" during config selection but failed at runtime with "not available (macOS only)" error on non-macOS systems.

**Solution:** Implemented proper OS detection during configuration phase.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:116-122` - Added `isSystemCacheAvailable()` helper function
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:597-601` - Created dedicated OS availability check

**Implementation Details:**
```go
// Before: Runtime failure
Available: true, // System cache cleaner always available (macOS detection at runtime)

// After: Config-time detection
Available: isSystemCacheAvailable(ctx),

func isSystemCacheAvailable(ctx context.Context) bool {
    cleaner, err := cleaner.NewSystemCacheCleaner(false, false, "30d")
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    return cleaner.IsAvailable(ctx)
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Platform-specific cleaners only shown when actually available
- ✅ Eliminates confusing "failed" messages for unavailable cleaners
- ✅ Improved user trust - only actionable options presented

---

### 2. Per-Cleaner Result Display

**Problem:** Generic "completed" messages provided no insight into what was actually cleaned.

**Solution:** Implemented detailed result reporting with specific metrics.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:341-356` - Added `printCleanerResult()` function
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:292-339` - Refactored `runCleaner()` to use new display logic

**Implementation Details:**
```go
func printCleanerResult(name string, result domain.CleanResult, dryRun bool) {
    details := ""
    if result.ItemsRemoved > 0 {
        if dryRun {
            details = fmt.Sprintf("would clean %d item(s)", result.ItemsRemoved)
        } else {
            details = fmt.Sprintf("cleaned %d item(s), freed %s",
                result.ItemsRemoved, format.Bytes(int64(result.FreedBytes)))
        }
    } else if result.FreedBytes > 0 {
        details = fmt.Sprintf("freed %s", format.Bytes(int64(result.FreedBytes)))
    } else {
        details = "no items to clean"
    }

    fmt.Printf("  ✓ %s cleaner: %s\n", name, details)
}
```

**Before:**
```
🔧 Running Nix cleaner...
  ✓ Nix cleaner completed
```

**After:**
```
🔧 Running Nix cleaner...
  ✓ Nix cleaner: cleaned 5 item(s), freed 1.2 GB
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users understand exactly what each cleaner accomplished
- ✅ Clear indication of disk space reclaimed
- ✅ Differentiates between dry-run and actual cleanup

---

### 3. Intelligent Error Categorization

**Problem:** All errors treated equally - "not available" cleaners counted as "failed," confusing users.

**Solution:** Implemented smart error categorization with `isNotAvailableError()` helper.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:264-307` - Enhanced error handling in main loop
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:590-603` - Added `isNotAvailableError()` function
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:6` - Added `strings` import
- `internal/cleaner/systemcache.go:211` - Improved error message

**Implementation Details:**
```go
func isNotAvailableError(errMsg string) bool {
    lowerMsg := strings.ToLower(errMsg)
    unavailableKeywords := []string{
        "not available",
        "not found",
        "not installed",
        "command not found",
        "no such file or directory",
    }

    for _, keyword := range unavailableKeywords {
        if strings.Contains(lowerMsg, keyword) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

**Error Handling Logic:**
```go
if err != nil {
    name := getCleanerName(cleanerType)
    errMsg := err.Error()

    // Check if this is a "not available" error vs actual failure
    if isNotAvailableError(errMsg) {
        skippedCleaners = append(skippedCleaners, name)
        fmt.Printf("  ℹ️  Skipped %s: %s\n", name, errMsg)
    } else {
        failedCleaners = append(failedCleaners, struct {
            name  string
            error string
        }{name: name, error: errMsg})
        fmt.Printf("  ❌ Cleaner %s failed: %s\n", name, errMsg)
    }
    continue
}
```

**Before:**
```
⚠️  Cleaner System Cache failed: system cache cleaner not available (macOS only)
✅ Cleanup completed...
   • 2 item(s) failed to clean  ← Misleading!
```

**After:**
```
ℹ️  Skipped Homebrew: homebrew not available
✅ Cleanup completed...
   • 1 cleaner(s) skipped (not available)  ← Accurate!
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clear distinction between platform limitations vs actual failures
- ✅ Users not alarmed by "failures" that are expected
- ✅ Accurate metrics for troubleshooting

---

### 4. Enhanced Summary Output

**Problem:** Summary lacked context about what was skipped or failed separately.

**Solution:** Comprehensive summary with separate counters and clear categorization.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:309-329` - Redesigned final summary section

**Implementation Details:**
```go
// Show final results
fmt.Printf("\n✅ Cleanup completed in %s\n", duration.String())
if dryRun {
    fmt.Println("   (DRY RUN: No actual changes were made)")
}
fmt.Printf("   • Cleaned %d item(s)\n", totalItemsRemoved)
fmt.Printf("   • Freed %s\n", format.Bytes(int64(totalBytesFreed)))

// Show errors and warnings
if totalItemsFailed > 0 {
    fmt.Printf("   • %d item(s) failed to clean\n", totalItemsFailed)
}
if len(skippedCleaners) > 0 {
    fmt.Printf("   • %d cleaner(s) skipped (not available)\n", len(skippedCleaners))
}
if len(failedCleaners) > 0 {
    fmt.Printf("   • %d cleaner(s) failed\n", len(failedCleaners))
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Complete picture of cleanup operation
- ✅ Clear separation of success, skip, and failure metrics
- ✅ Better context for post-cleanup decisions

---

### 5. Removed Generic Success Messages

**Problem:** Each cleaner function printed identical "✓ XXX cleaner completed" messages, providing no value.

**Solution:** Moved all result display to centralized `printCleanerResult()` function.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/clean-wizard/commands/clean.go:357-360, 370-373, 383-386, 396-399, 409-412, 426-429, 441-444, 456-459, 471-474` - Removed generic success messages from all cleaner functions

**Impact:**
- ✅ Consistent output format across all cleaners
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication
- ✅ Easier to maintain and extend

---

### 6. Improved Error Messages

**Problem:** Generic error messages provided no actionable guidance.

**Solution:** Enhanced error messages with specific context and platform requirements.

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/cleaner/systemcache.go:211` - Improved error message

**Before:**
```go
return result.Err[domain.CleanResult](fmt.Errorf("system cache cleaner not available (macOS only)"))
```

**After:**
```go
return result.Err[domain.CleanResult](fmt.Errorf("not available on this platform (requires macOS)"))
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clear platform requirement statement
- ✅ Matches error categorization keywords
- ✅ Better user understanding

## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISION POINTS

### Parallel Execution Design (BLOCKER)

**Question:** How should we handle partial failures and output ordering when running cleaners in parallel?

**Options:**
1. **Buffered Output:** Collect all results, display in original order (user-friendly, delayed feedback)
2. **Real-time Output:** Show results as cleaners complete (immediate feedback, potentially confusing order)
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Show real-time progress, buffer final summary (balanced)

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach - real-time progress bars with buffered final summary

**Rationale:**
- Users want immediate feedback (don't want to stare at blank screen)
- Final summary needs to be ordered and comprehensive
- Progress bars give sense of overall completion

**Requires:** User confirmation on preferred approach
